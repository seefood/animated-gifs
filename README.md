# animated-gifs
Based on the huge collection (~2700) of the animated gifs Snipe uses on 
http://tumblr.snipe.net plus additions (~1500) by SeeFood.

Some are JPGs, but we can live with that, right?

Update for 2018: As more sites start supporting WebM, I kept/converted larger
GIF files to mp4 and WebM. Twitter and others block files over 5MB anyway.

Update for 2023: WebM is still not replacing GIFs. This is stupid but here we are.

**Note: This repo is big. It has ~4.2k animated gifs, and they're all awesome,
but it's big and it will take some time to download/clone.**

**If you want to get just the images without past junk (save 14G of disk space),
I suggest you get the zip with files only, or git clone with --depth 1. You'll thanks me.**

I try to rename them to meaningful names and cull dupes, but you are welcome to
help.  I need to do this for my own sanity (and so I can find the right gif
when I need it), but it will take a little time to get everything categorized
and appropriately named.

You're welcome to add to this repo (Seefood) or Snipe's, but understand that/
We're each picky with our different forks. If we don't accept your pull request
because your gif isn't punchy enough, don't be sad. This isn't a collection of
all gifs - this is a collection of gifs that I found to be particularly
funny/biting/weird/useful.  It's nothing personal.

There is no porn in this repo, although there may be hilarious depictions of
sex toys or other things I find funny. Please don't submit a PR with porn. The
internet has enough of that on its own, it doesn't need my help. 

Enjoy!

### Copyrights

The copyrights to the actual images belong to their respective intellectual
property copyright holders, blah blah blah. Snipe (and Seefood) have collected these
over a period of years, so we couldn't tell you where we found most of them,
and we're reasonably certain the folks we nicked them from couldn't tell you
where they originally found them either. Internet, amirite?

The few we can trace back come from:
- Aaron Reynolds' [@swear_trek](https://twitter.com/swear_trek), [@swear_who](https://twitter.com/swear_who) and [@GIFpocalypse](https://twitter.com/GIFpocalypse). Some of the credits also go to [@krissy_myers](https://twitter.com/krissy_myers), [@charliejane](https://twitter.com/charliejane) and others.
- Israeli memes and GIFs from [@fastish](https://twitter.com/fastish) and [@shkooME](https://twitter.com/shkooME).
- A few originals by me, [Ira](https://tooot.im/@I).
- Many from [@rabihalameddine](https://twitter.com/rabihalameddine)'s copious collection of cute and weird.
- [Slim Jim Studios](http://www.slimjimstudios.com/).
- Let me know if you identify others that I'm not aware of.

### Original creator of the collection:

Hi, I'm snipe. I write free, open source software for a living for my company,
Grokability, Inc. I wrote [Snipe-IT](https://snipeitapp.com) (a FOSS IT asset
management system), I'm the CTO and co-founder of [Mass Mosaic](https://massmosaic.com),
and I created the [Downworthy browser plugin](http://downworthy.snipe.net). I also made 
[Nofuckstogive.today](http://nofuckstogive.today), which you might enjoy.

You can find me on the Twitters [@snipeyhead](https://twitter.com/snipeyhead).

### Additionals:

I'm Ira, [@i@tooot.im](https://tooot.im/@I) on the fediverse. I'm into
Digital/Online rights, FOSS, Open Information and the social equality+freedoms
movements with which they share a lot. I make money from Systems Automation and
programming (sometimes called DevOps), and I often talk about science
skepticism, Digital Rights, the maker movement and other topics at SciFi Cons,
where I work very hard not to include too many GIFs in my slides. It's a daily
battle.
